                <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
                <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
                    Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist
                    Brayn Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green,
                    bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band
                    achieved its frist commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
                    attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular
                    acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat's Meow),
                    Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to
                    sign with Magenta Records.<br><br>
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking
                    in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the
                    band's original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest
                    and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                    themselves as "The Hive" and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on
                    stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording
                    their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
